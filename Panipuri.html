    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Panipuri, also known as golgappa, puchka, or phuchka in various regions of India, is a popular street food snack. It consists of small, round, hollow puris (fried crisp bread) filled with a mixture of flavored water (pani), tamarind chutney, chili, chaat masala, potato, onion, and chickpeas.
        The preparation of panipuri involves several steps. First, the puris are made by deep-frying unleavened dough until they puff up and become crispy. Then, they are cooled and stored until ready to be served. The flavored water, or pani, is made by blending various ingredients such as mint, coriander, green chili, tamarind, and spices with water. This mixture is strained to remove any solid pieces, resulting in a refreshing and tangy liquid.
        To assemble the panipuri, a small hole is made in the puri, and a spoonful of mashed potato, chickpeas, and diced onion is added. The puri is then filled with the flavored water using a small ladle or spoon, and optionally topped with additional chutneys or spices according to personal preference. The entire puri is then eaten in one bite, providing a burst of flavors and textures in the mouth.
        Panipuri is cherished not only for its delicious taste but also for the experience it offers the joy of watching it being assembled by street vendors, the anticipation of the burst of flavor with each bite, and the communal aspect of enjoying it with friends and family. It is a quintessential part of Indian street food culture and is enjoyed by people of all ages across the country.
